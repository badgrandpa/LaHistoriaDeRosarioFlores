0.000|		 
0.400|		What is it, gentlemen?
2.320|		asked Estefano, and they all turned with a gesture to the priest.
7.640|		Father Pascual then took a certain air of gravity and replied
12.760|		It's about Mrs. Lucia calling us to advocate for some
18.000|		sneaky, cheating, Indians not wanting to pay what they owe.
21.960|		And for this he has used words that, frankly, as Don Sebastiï¿½n says,
26.720|		understood by the Indians, they actually destroy us,
29.280|		our habits, mitas, pongos and so on.
33.400|		We won't consent. What the hell!
35.680|		Shouted Estefano and all the listeners.
38.680|		And Don Sebastian added with refined
41.240|		malice: he's even proposed free burial for the poor.
46.000|		And so, frankly, how does the pastor run out of crops?
52.080|		The statement did not have the effect in the audience that the priest's peroration
57.440|		oF Father Pascual, which is easy to explain by attending
61.320|		that deep down there was the convenience of a fatal, executive self.
66.280|		However, Estefano spoke on behalf
68.600|		of everyone, connecting to say "Go with the pretensions of those outsiders.
75.520|		We must once and for all remedy those bad teachings.
80.800|		We must get rid of any stranger who comes here without wanting to support our
85.560|		customs, because we, frankly, are children of the people, said Don Sebastian,
91.720|		Raising his voice with haughtiness and
93.880|		arriving at the table to serve a drink to the parish priest.
97.720|		Yes, sir.
99.120|		We are in our village,
101.800|		as born in the land, owners of the land, legitimate Peruvians,
108.960|		the others were saying, but no one thought to ask if the
112.920|		Marin couple were not Peruvian because they were born in the capital.
117.160|		Careful, careful, don't make yourself felt.
121.960|		And work, the priest added,
124.840|		marking the hypocritical doctrine that
127.000|		deceives the brother and disorients the father.
130.160|		And that afternoon
131.600|		it was agreed upon in the Civil Authority
134.080|		Chamber, in the presence of the ecclesiastical authority,
138.080|		the hatred that was to envelop the honest
140.960|		Don Fernando in the wave of blood that produced
144.080|		a friendly, charitable request from his wife.
