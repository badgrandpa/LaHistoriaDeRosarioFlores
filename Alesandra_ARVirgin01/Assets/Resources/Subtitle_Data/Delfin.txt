1.520|		Dear Aunt Clorenda,
3.560|		I've been hiding out here on this estate for a long time,
7.560|		asking God to sell the work of birds without a nest,
11.680|		so that you can give me back my money, what smoke was made and what being
16.840|		Mother, don't come back and let me go out of these reed and cane forests
22.720|		because of your bad manners I haven't arrived
24.840|		to say tails, because in a corner you
27.720|		taught me how to suck rum and you threw cognac.
31.160|		You've been tomboying with the men in the
33.760|		fray, they'll give you a piece of their mind.
36.440|		You don't see it because you're blind.
38.240|		And he shuffles like my male,
40.880|		with the smell you give off, which is the smell of vinegar,
44.040|		you'll be running at a hundred with the same old skunk that uses the same tricks
49.040|		no matter how much you go down and turn
51.440|		those spectacles upside down, they're just drunk.
54.240|		You'll always be Maritornes, and write suckers.
58.800|		Hang yourself a deck of keys, get into a bargepole, get out of a bird's nest.
64.680|		Well, you don't even know how to spell it. My money, you old ham,
69.440|		At the expense of my money you publish filthy, trashy pages,
74.640|		scalpels and barbers and counterfeit sheaths.
78.920|		Don't flatter me, Sugar Mules,
81.120|		the largest among the large that graze in the regions.
84.560|		What I want is your ark, not your Andean pasquin.
89.000|		I'll go in with a rein and without lifting your clothes I'll apply you in
93.400|		the back of a reverend plush for slander and for opacity.
98.400|		And with that he says goodbye, and more if necessary his old nest-less bird.
103.800|		There every nephew
106.120|		by Narcissus Chains, because he can't sign.
