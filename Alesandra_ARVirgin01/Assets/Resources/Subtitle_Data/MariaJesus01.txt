0.800|		It is indisputable that women have the right
3.360|		to life, to get the most out of it.
7.360|		Therefore, it is the sacred duty of the State
9.920|		put her in a position to obtain these advantages to the extent of her abilities.
14.720|		And since the economic order is intimately related to the civil and political order,
19.040|		women have the option to enjoy full rights
22.680|		that laws guarantee, the welfare of the human in the civilized world.
27.160|		And looking at the matter exclusively
29.640|		by the aspect of motherhood, of the sacred mission of the Mother to form
33.600|		the heart and character of the child, flows the need for the woman to be
37.920|		vastly educated, fit, and enjoying without limitation
42.200|		of the rights and fulfil the duties that these imply, so that with the force
46.400|		example, form the personality of the citizen in
50.480|		the integrity of complex human functions. Stubbornly opposed.
55.160|		Anti-feminists still argue in every association, however small,
59.920|		like marriage, it takes an authority to bring order.
63.720|		If you release the woman from subordination
65.800|		the husband, anarchy, chaos, the dissolution of the family will come.
70.120|		It will not be so, for nature, with its wise laws,
73.880|		will avoid this catastrophe by establishing natural subordination.
78.160|		The brain with the greatest psychic
80.280|		potential, be it intellectual or emotional,
82.680|		will dominate the weakest, whether in the man's head or the woman's.
87.200|		Thus, if she has the superiority, she will
89.280|		be the one that governs the marriage society,
91.680|		like its done day to day and from remote times
95.240|		the mandate of the law says with nobility,
98.920|		why this ridiculous hypocrisy this vain pride and puerile terror
103.400|		of reality? Why not recognize in law what in fact exists?
