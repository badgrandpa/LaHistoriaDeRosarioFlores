1.920|		Reading has a very powerful influence on our spirit.
7.880|		She is the lenient for many evils of life and the opium.
12.440|		With which to lull the pains of the soul for a moment
17.320|		for the thinking man,
19.080|		Reading is the necessary food to
21.640|		nourish their spirit and also the rich
24.000|		Berge where their intelligence is broadened.
26.920|		In a world of ideas that,
28.520|		by assimilating it to their being, they
30.920|		identify with that whole that forms their soul.
35.080|		A man who doesn't read is like those plants whose branches
39.440|		no care has been taken to segregate the farsighted hand of the farmer
44.520|		to give the new shoots more vigour and freshness.
49.760|		Similarly, intelligence needs
53.360|		through study, to uproot the old worries
57.560|		and wrong so that new and beneficial ideas can come to fruition.
