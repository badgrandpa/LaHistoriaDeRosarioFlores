2.480|		Rosario Flores is a Posthumanist virgin, who has encoded within her
9.280|		the relics of a culture that was once intoxicated by biological sin.
16.440|		She was born on October 8, 2202 in Lima, Peru.
22.800|		And she's one of the many Posthumanist virgins
25.200|		who wander the bridges between flesh and the code.
30.800|		Like most virgins, she's programmed with a purpose.
36.440|		To carry the rubble of a culture that once believed in God.
41.880|		Becoming an archaeological site
45.480|		where violence against women is unearthed in Peru.
50.880|		Inside her veil she wears embroidery of avant-garde women,
56.040|		TV shows and ungrateful animals.
60.560|		Alone, she fulfils her mission by wandering the confines of cyberspace
67.760|		for any cyber-archaeologist to discover.
