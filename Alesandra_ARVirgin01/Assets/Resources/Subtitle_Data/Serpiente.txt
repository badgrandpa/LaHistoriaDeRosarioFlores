0.000|		  
0.360|		It's just that the woman, first of all, is a woman
3.800|		and many of them are mothers.
6.440|		So many times we find an ideology,
11.720|		a way of thinking, a prejudice in which one does not want to accept
17.560|		that there are women and there are men.
21.680|		It's two sexes, female and male.
25.680|		That's the way God wanted it.
27.280|		And so they are wonderfully accepted in humanity.
33.400|		But for some time now, in Beijing, 95, last century,
38.400|		they started a whole campaign to get rid of the fact
42.200|		That there are no sexes, there are genders.
46.600|		I think that's an imposition
50.760|		which comes, of course, from the most developed countries,
54.240|		because that way they break the structure of society
58.960|		which is made up of men and women, or women and men
63.880|		in a peaceful, serene and good way.
66.480|		And that in these years and as President Kuczynski said,
71.120|		you have to give them (women) that treatment in the professional aspect,
75.600|		in the cultural aspect, in the sporting aspect, a political aspect.
80.240|		Still, they do have the same rights
84.120|		and duties, but they're not the same in that sense of nature.
88.960|		The nature of the male sex
92.000|		is different than the nature of the female sex or not?
96.080|		But who's arguing about this?
97.640|		The gender ideology, because they start at a young age to want
102.880|		to teach the children a whole functional situation.
108.920|		I mean, your function in society is like that and so on.
112.520|		You have to get rid of these taboos.
114.920|		It's not a taboo, but the child is a little man
119.240|		and the girl is a little woman and she
122.800|		just has to see her body and when it grows.
126.680|		Their female and male psychology is diverse
132.600|		and it's no more and no less.
134.160|		It has nothing to do with the abuse that male chauvinism wants
141.080|		pose. That's not, that's not right.
143.720|		And there's a big, positive movement to regain respect.
147.400|		But I would also say: women
149.960|		also regain respect for not being used as a
154.520|		on TV, your body is not a purely sexual attraction.
160.960|		Then I believe that those means
163.600|		of communication that constantly spread violence.
169.720|		Violence against women, too.
172.680|		And also that they spread that abuse of the body as carnal physical attraction
180.880|		in very subtle ways and schedules, but they create a whole situation
187.320|		that then the statistics tell us that there are abortions of girls.
192.120|		But it's not because the girls were abused.
194.320|		It's often because the woman puts herself on display, provoking.
201.920|		I think it is also an important task for parents,
207.600|		from schools and the media.
211.120|		Do not use sexual attraction as easily as a commercial product.
