0.000|		 
0.320|		My mates... I don't know what's in their heads, really.
4.120|		I feel very sorry for them.
6.200|		That being old school.
8.560|		They have fallen in the game.
11.160|		You know what happened.
13.640|		They have fallen into the game of the youngsters.
17.800|		So, it no longer works for them, I'm telling you,
20.040|		because the don'r renew themselves, their old jokes are no longer funny.
26.400|		I think they've fallen into the bad game of watching the youngsters do the regaetton dance,
32.880|		the perreo dance, the easy humor, the youngsters do get some laughs .
37.240|		They think, Oh, I'm also gonna do that,
38.640|		but it looks ridiculously, to see a  50 year old pulling down his trousers.
44.120|		It's gonna look ridiculous.
46.320|		I mean, making that cheap humor
48.640|		of insulting, ma'am, if you don't cooperate with some change I'm going to rape you.
55.080|		Those things  they shock me, they make me indignant.
57.840|		I do totally repudiate any
62.840|		offense against women, right? There's a difference in the total.
67.000|		There is a difference in the category
68.440|		of the comedians who used to stand in the same squares?
72.200|		Yeah, totally. I.
76.600|		. .
77.800|		I greatly admired the poets on the streets.
80.640|		The thing is, the guys now.
83.640|		And some old ones.
85.080|		That I know, the scandals they've made.
87.800|		They're two old ones.
90.840|		They don't read.
92.480|		They don't prepare.
94.960|		Because we're all ignorant, all of us, I'll give you that.
99.160|		We're all ignorant.
100.520|		Even the most educated person has something they don't know.
104.880|		Because we learn every day. Uh.
109.320|		. .
110.960|		I don't know.
112.400|		No, they don't immerse themselves in what's going on day to day
116.520|		and they just tell the joke so brutally and they don't care.
121.120|		If the lady is offended, They're not interested.
124.120|		If the joke offended him, I don't know how, they don't care if a guy
127.560|		felt bad because he threw back the coin he had given him.
130.400|		I mean, that.
132.040|		Such acts are ignorant.
136.400|		What, you have to do. .
139.760|		. I don't know.
142.080|		Rethink themselves, right?
144.800|		to do a mea culpa, but it's also not
148.720|		to say: ok i'll just record a video of me.
151.200|		Gentlemen of Peru!
152.800|		A thousand apologies. To err is human.
155.280|		That line is no longer. .
156.880|		. To really apologize.
158.520|		I know that the apologies they've said , are not-
160.920|		I know them well, I know who, and I know they didn't do it from the heart.
166.800|		They haven't done it from the heart.
170.240|		I'm going to apologize now, to the press.
171.720|		A thousand apologies to the lady I offended.
173.320|		Apologies to the woman.
174.720|		And now you doo support women
177.760|		Now you doo recognize that you've made a mistake
180.400|		and your excuse is that those videos were 14 years ago. I have
184.400|		I have videos from back in the day
186.480|		Fifteen years and I don't get asked to say anything. Why?
190.520|		It's a question of how, how do you order your work?
193.560|		I mean.
196.440|		And like I said, they have fallen for the new boys' game, the easy humor.
