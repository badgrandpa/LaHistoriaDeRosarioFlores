About:
Rosario Flores is a Posthuman Virgin who has encoded within her the relics of a culture once intoxicated by biological sin. She was born on the 8th of October 2202, in Lima Peru, and is one of many Posthuman Virgins roaming the bridges between flesh and code. 

Like most virgins, she is programmed with a purpose: she is to carry debris of a culture that once believed in God, she is an archeological site for machismo in Peruvian culture. Within her vail, she carries stories of empowerment as well as suffering and is set to roam the confinements of cyberspace for any cyber-archaeologist to discover.

The technology that I used for this project was Augmented Reality. I am absolutely mesmerized by this medium and feel like artists are not using it enough and that I have been exploring for the past years in my practice. I think that this medium is extraordinary because it can be used to reveal things hidden in the physical world. It has the potential to bring in magic realism into the ordinary by augmenting your surroundings and seducing you to discover. Nevertheless, the technology was just one aspect of the technicalities of my piece. I also had to design the physically augmentable garment as well as the illustrated image targets and the AR app itself... yikes! 

For the development of the AR app itself, I used Unity as my main engine and Vuforia to create AR Image Targets. This was my second time working with Vuforia instead of ARKit/ARCore, the main reason for choosing this is that you can build for android and iOS much quicker and don't have to download heaps of different packages for each individual platform. Vuforia also has the upper hand on quick prototyping as it allows for the use of the webcam to test as you work instead of having to build to a device every time you want to test AR.
